  # BoostNoteBlogger - III
  Where did we manage to go and what is still on our roadmap?
  Where were our main issues and what went surprisingly easy?
  
  ## What did we manage to do?
  Although we planned for a lot of things, this is what we have achieved in the X days of development.  
  
  - [x] Extract content from our notes and convert into markdown / metadata
  - [x] Convert metadata in easy to access information
  - [x] Write biggest part of it in a test-first approach
  - [x] Create a decent-enough html template
  - [x] Wrap our content in html
  - [x] Have a very dynamic configurationsystem
  
  ## What did we plan for but didn't manage to do in time
  
  - [ ] Proper multiple-times cleanup
  - [ ] Proper testing not only for 100% coverage, but for 100% usecase
  - [ ] Configuration wizard that inits what we still need
  
  ## What is our roadmap
  - [ ] Attachments
  - [ ] Optimize this GH Actions thing -> Properly set the index.html etc.
  - [ ] Add mor flags with sane options
  - [ ] Move configuration from pure env-vars defined in code to a config file with default in `.config/bnb`
  - [ ] Fulltyping with mypy hooks
  - [ ] Proper README with a full wiki
  - [ ] Integration within BoostNote itself?
  
  ## Biggest issues
  ### Github Actions
  I'm somewhat familiar with Jenkins, Travis CI and Gitlab CI.  
  Used Docker before and made my own docker-compose files.  
  
  But that thing... it scares me.ðŸ˜°ðŸ˜°ðŸ˜°
  
  #### 1. Un (or over) -welcome Actions page
  It's filled with all kinds of random actions templates you can use, depending on what you need.  
  But of course every reload shows different results, and it's never quite the one you need.  
  Then there's knowing whether you want the know if the action is 1. to deploy somewhere, 2. just a continuous workflow or 3. something to automate every step in your process.  
  
  ***HMMMMMMMMM***
  
  Turned out not to be difficult **at all**, you just need to get going and say *"fuck all of this Imma do it myself!"* and start a workflow from scratch.  
  Unbelievable how long it took to make sense, even with someone else who's used this before trying to work with me to get it setup but him also getting lost.
