<h1>BoostNoteBlogger - I</h1>
<p>So this is the first entry in, hopefully, a lot more of these posts where I use myself as 🦆 the rubber ducky 🦆. </p>
<h2>Soooo, what are ya tryin' to achieve there, buddy?</h2>
<p>I've always wanted to set up a blog and post periodically, but none of the options out there really spoke to me.<br>
It's either oversimplified that I cannot use and interface I like, or overcomplicated with too many options where setting everything up/writing takes up more of time than just writing.<br>
What I need is just something I can plug into my current workflow, because <em>I don't like change</em>.</p>
<h3>Okay sure but what's your workflow then?</h3>
<p>Markdown fits my purpose. It's easy to write, relatively easy to keep clean and it's integrated in most services.<br>
From all editors I've tried, BoostNote is the one that always works best imo.<br>
Configurable enough so that I can setup multiple storages, and simple enough that I don't need to think about everything and can just jump into writing.</p>
<h2>The main flow</h2>
<p>There are 5 base things that we need to think about in this context;
<strong>How do we</strong>
1. create the content?
2. recognize notes as blogging entries?
3. generate HTML from these MD files with extra logic?
4. publish?
5. interact with everything?</p>
<h3>1. Creating the content</h3>
<p>We'll use BoostNote for this.
<em>Note: We're </em><em>not</em><em> using the newer BoostNoteNext, since this works fine for our case.</em></p>
<h3>2. Structure and manage entries for our blog</h3>
<p>We'll most likely need a centralized <code>index.md</code> file to fallback on, linking all entries together.<br>
For now we've setup a new <strong>storage location</strong> just for the blog, and added <strong>a folder per topic</strong>.
This way of working I believe we can easily categorize entries,
but if we want to link the relevant parts of a series, we can use <strong>tags</strong>.</p>
<p>All of this information can be extracted from the metadata stored in the files.</p>
<p>For now I believe this is the easiest approach.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">~/dev/blog
        -&gt; Default
            -&gt; index.md
        -&gt; Programming
            -&gt; BoostNoteBlogger - I
            -&gt; BoostNoteBlogger - II
            -&gt; CsonToMarkdown - I
            -&gt; BoostNoteBlogger - III
        -&gt; Music
        -&gt; Other
</code></pre>
<h3>3. Generating HTML and injecting custom logic</h3>
<p>This heavily depends on which library we use to parse (and if we decide to write our own of course).<br>
<a href="https://python-markdown.github.io/">Python-Markdown</a> seems like a good choice, especially due to their <em>Extension API</em>,
but I haven't looked into it, so everything's open to change.</p>
<h3>4. Publishing HTML</h3>
<p>GH-pages seems like the easiest (and free-est) way to go, but how do we get there?<br>
My first thought was to use my other <code>cson-to-markdown</code> tool as a post-commit hook again, everytime I update the notes folder and commit the changes,<br>
but that was immediatly dismissed, since that means we'd generate HTML locally. <strong>We don't want to track it locally.</strong><br>
Some birdie whispered to me that GH actions can achieve the behaviour we want, I'm interested to see if we can get the same with Gitlab as well,<br>
but since we're most likely going to use GH Pages, actions make the most sense.</p>
<p>We'll have a pipeline that triggers the HTML generation from the Markdown in the repo, so we're not keeping double files.  </p>
<h3>5. Interfacing</h3>
<p>I've always been a sucker for <em>cool and flashy ncurses-like interfaces</em>, but I want to get out of the way as much as possible.<br>
The library <strong>questionary</strong> seems like a good place to start with a set-up.<br>
The more options the application can offer the user by <strong>pure, sane defaults</strong>, the better.<br>
Noone wants to enter a path each time they use the same application, you want to get/set a sort of profile and store settings for reuse.</p>        </div>
